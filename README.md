# Scattergories Web App

This is an online version of the popular board game Scattergories!
For anyone unfamiliar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattergories

I developed this project for my Web Applications Security class.
Currently it functions as an avenue for people to play the game
together online without having to own the board game.

I plan on adding a backend to the project for given answers to be
automatically checked/compared, and for points to be given and kept
track of appropriately. For now, it can be played essentially the
same way the board game would be played, just over the internet.

Every game has a unique ID. You can create your own and have your
friends join, or join someone else's by typing in the ID of their
game. The rest functions like normal Scattergories. Enjoy!

The game can be played here:
