- a lobby should have a max capacity that will be checked to prevent others from joining. This number should be shown to the
    current lobby members as well

- a lobby object in the database should have the list of users currently in it with their user IDs and all their info, 
    the number of users currently in it, if the game is currently running, if all users are ready for the game to start, the lobby code,

- a user object should have the unique userID, the screen name, if their ready, their answers, current points

- !======= How do I want to measure points and display answers to the group? =======!

- need a dictionary to check if a word is real

- need a string formatter to make sure it matches the dictioaries

- need a way to check if a word starts with a certain letter

================== KNOWN BUGS ===================
- only the person who presses start will be able to input answers -- likely because pressing start will disable or enable answer fields 
    -- can probably fix by basing disable on gameRunning and not pressing start

- if a user is in a running game, then leaves and immediately joins another game, it will keep the timer ticking and the categories on screen
