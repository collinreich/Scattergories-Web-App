================== FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY ===================

Lobby related:

- a lobby should have a max capacity that will be checked to prevent others from joining. This number should be shown to the
    current lobby members as well

Game mechanics related:

- need a dictionary to check if a word is real

- need a string formatter to make sure it matches the dictioaries

- need a way to check if a word starts with a certain letter

- develop a way to store answers for users in the database -- probably in the userAnswers field of the user json object

- develop a way to compare answers between users -- should this be done with Node?

- distribute points appropriately -- probably in currentScore field of user json object, this can be rendered on leaderboard next to names

================== KNOWN BUGS ===================
- only the person who presses start will be able to input answers -- likely because pressing start will disable or enable answer fields 
    -- can probably fix by basing disable on gameRunning and not pressing start

- if a user is in a running game, then leaves and immediately joins another game, it will keep the timer ticking and the categories on screen

- when I try to remove a game after everyone has left, it deletes everything before anyone even leaves

================== IMPROVEMENTS / TODO LIST ===================
- turn off click listeners and such, I think its filling up the cache but I don't fully get what that means yet.

- right now everything is based on firebase as like a dynamic class; go through and either update the local js GameState class, or remove the unessecary code 
    -- regardless of if I end up updating the local GameState class or not, there is unessecary code within it that I need to clean out

- allow users to pick the length of the round

- only allow game to start when all users click ready; can base this on the "isReady" property of each user, that's what it's for

- general cleanup and refactoring, there's a lot of mess and inefficiency and redundancy, it can definitely be cleaned

- organize leaderboard top to bottom by scores

- display all users answers to everyone so everyone can see what everybody put
